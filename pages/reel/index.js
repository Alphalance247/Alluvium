              </h3>
              <p className={styles.projectReelInfo}>
                We helped a major UK bank set up an entirely new way of working
                by using Atlassian tools and process in conjunction with their
                existing legacy tools. This delivery included meeting compliance
                standard to satisfy the stringent ISO and Audit requirements of
                the compliance department of the institution. This helped to
                bring structure and organisation during this massive change.
                Part of the legacy systems and tools involved in the migration
                included taiga.io, migration of 2 Jira servers to Jira Cloud and
                integration of SharePoint with Confluence.

              </h3>
              <p className={styles.projectReelInfo}>
                At the time a major telco company was going through a
                multimillion-pound transformation program, we came to help bring
                structure, simplicity, and scalability to their Safe Agile way
                of working adoption. This required restructuring of the entire
                Atlassian product set up, setting up of new configuration to
                help with progress reporting using advanced roadmap and BigGant,
                dependency tracking using Big Picture solution board. As part of
                the delivery, regular training and workshops were organised and
                delivered by our team to get the clients staffs comfortable with
                the tools usage.

                Jira Server/Jira Service Desk Migration
              </h3>
              <p className={styles.projectReelInfo}>
                The client had their instance being hosted on a 3rd party’s
                server and wanted options when it was time to renew the hosting
                license, the client wanted options that would help reduce cost
                and improve efficiency within their delivery. A feasibility
                report was provided to compare but on prem and cloud hosting of
                Atlassian and a cost benefit analysis was provide, once all the
                security questions and checks were satisfactorily answered, the
                client took the cloud recommendation and we proceeded to set up
                Atlassian cloud products (Jira, Confluence and Jira Service
                Desk) and then migrated the existing 3rd party hosted instances
                to the cloud in a timely manner to prevent them from getting
                double billed as their license was almost ready for renewal.
                This delivery included setting up of new reporting dashboard for
                the different teams, workflows, automation around their change
                and ticket management processes as ell as building a customer
                centric service desk portal.
